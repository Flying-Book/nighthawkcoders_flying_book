    "# Summary\n",
    "1. Conditional Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conditionals are used to make decisions in a program based on certain conditions.\n",
    "- They enable the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.\n",
    "2. Types of Conditionals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.\n",
    "- else: Provides an alternative block of code to execute when the \"if\" condition is false.\n",
    "- elif (else if): Used for multiple conditional checks in a sequence.\n",
    "- switch (in some programming languages): Allows branching based on multiple possible values.\n",
    "2. Boolean Expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conditions are typically expressed as boolean expressions, which evaluate to either true or false.\n",
    "- Examples include comparisons (e.g., x > 5) and logical operators (e.g., if (x > 5 && y < 10)).\n",
    "3. Nested Conditionals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conditionals can be nested within one another to handle more complex decision-making.\n",
    "4. Default and Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider adding a \"default\" or \"else\" case to handle unexpected conditions or errors.\n",
    "- Pseudo Code\n",
