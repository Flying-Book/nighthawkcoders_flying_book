# Summary
- In CSP, algorithms are fundamental to problem-solving and computational thinking.
- An algorithm is a precise set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem or performing a task.
- Psuedo code can be used to display a algorithm. Pseudocode is often used to represent algorithms in CSP. It's a way to outline the steps without using specific programming language syntax.
~~~
function factorial(n)
    if n = 0
        return 1
    else
        result = 1
        for i from 1 to n
            result = result * i
        end for
        return result
    end if
end function

- Optimization reduces Time complexity (Big O Notation)
- Examples may include sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and data analysis.
