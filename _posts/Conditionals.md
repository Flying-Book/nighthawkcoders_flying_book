# Summary
1. Conditional Statements:

- Conditionals are used to make decisions in a program based on certain conditions.
- They enable the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.
2. Types of Conditionals:

- if: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- else: Provides an alternative block of code to execute when the "if" condition is false.
- elif (else if): Used for multiple conditional checks in a sequence.
- switch (in some programming languages): Allows branching based on multiple possible values.
2. Boolean Expressions:

- Conditions are typically expressed as boolean expressions, which evaluate to either true or false.
- Examples include comparisons (e.g., x > 5) and logical operators (e.g., if (x > 5 && y < 10)).
3. Nested Conditionals:

- Conditionals can be nested within one another to handle more complex decision-making.
4. Default and Error Handling:

- Consider adding a "default" or "else" case to handle unexpected conditions or errors.
