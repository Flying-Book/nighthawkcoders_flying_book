<h5 style = "margin-left: 20px;"> Version Control </h5>

<p style = "margin: 20px;"> <strong> Version control </strong> is a way of tracking changes to code. Proper version control will allow you to acess previous versions of code. We can use github and git lense to track changes to our code and revert code if nessesary. You can use push and pull commands to send and recieve data to a repository. You can later look at the version tree to restore previous versions. Git Lense is a extension that helps you manage the version tree of Git Hub easily. </p>
