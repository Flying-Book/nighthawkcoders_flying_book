This week, Anusha and I were struggling with a lot of errors from our website. My primary issues were a result of nbconvert not installing correctly and my jekyll gem not correctly installing as well. To fix this error, we read through various Github issues threads among other helpful resources to fix our error. We also tried editing the snake game, the calculator, and the game of life. We also decided what we wanted to build during the following week. Unfortunately, both of us got sick during the week and were unable to come to class. As a result, we really struggled to catch up with the rest of the class when we got back. We had to learn how to add games and program them ourselves. We learned that you can not place files under site otherwise they will be deleted.
